## Anomaly and causality detection in Maritime Data

# Scope

Anomaly detection in maritime data can help with legal investigations or help
comercial transport



AIS and weather Data sample from Spire Maritime

```
source:spire.com
```

**Bayesian Networks** using two models:

1. **Time series** model
2. **Track summary** model


# Tools

CaMML (Causal discovery via Minimum Message Length)

```
source:bayesian-intelligence.com
```

Data is combined, cleaned,
fed to the tool and also
refined and re-introduced in
the learner via the two
methods:
● Time Series
● Track Summary


# Usage

You can use **discrete_time_series.py** or **discrete_track_summaries.py**

One is taking AIS data and checks anomalies based on time (one ship in the
sea can be missing at 10 AM at specific location, which is bad because usually
it’s there at that time)

Another one is track records and its’ used to show for example that ships in
the middle of the ocean usually are bigger


# Usage

When you run one of the scripts it will download some AIS sample and

```
● Clean data
● Make continuous variable into discrete (instead of ship 500m -> ship has
value ‘large’)
● Output a new CSV file
```

# Usage

Run camml_gui.sh with the new CSV
